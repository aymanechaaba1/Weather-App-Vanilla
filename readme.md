# Weather App with Vanilla JS

Powering my build with https://openweathermap.org/api. Really cool API to get all the weather data you need.

Please add your OpenWeatherMap API_KEY to make the app working.

Search expects a city name like 'tokyo' or 'new york'.

I added the Mapbox API because I will add later a map that displays the location of the searched city.
